				Systemic constellation work allows us to uncover these unconscious mechanisms. It works by literally setting up a picture of the relevant parts of a system with physical representatives. This allows us to take an outside perspective. Since the language of such a picture has been shown to be universal, it can be analysed.
				We are enabled to see what was unconscious before and can to work with it now. This happens in two ways:

				<div class="row">
					<div class="divide20"></div>
					<ul class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-2 style-1">
						<li>
							<i class="fa fa-caret-right" ></i>
							<p >The fact that we see something that we did not know before, allows us to change something or act differently later.</p></li>
						<li>
							<i class="fa fa-caret-right" ></i>
							<p>By working consciously on a picture of a system, we inherently influence what is unconscious: e.g. balance can be brought back to a system or tensions can be released.
							   As a result, we may experience changes in “real life” after a systemic constellation.</p></li>
